# Data Structures Lab
Implemented  fundamental  algorithms  like  sorting  and  searching  and  simple  data  structures  like arrays, linked lists, trees and graphs.  Analyzed  the  computing  problems  given  and  assess  the  suitability  of  different  data  structures 
and algorithms to solve the problems. Designed  and  implemented  algorithmic  solutions  within  suitable  time  constraints.
